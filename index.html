            <em>Sir Nicholas George Winton MBE</em> <strong>(né Wertheim; 19 May 1909 – 1 July 2015)</strong> was a British stockbroker and humanitarian               who helped to rescue Jewish children who were at risk of being murdered by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. Born to             German-Jewish parents who had emigrated to Britain at the beginning of the 20th century, Winton assisted in the                   rescue of 669 children, most of them Jewish, from Czechoslovakia on the eve of World War II. On a brief visit to                 Czechoslovakia, he helped compile a list of children needing rescue and, returning to Britain, he worked to fulfil               the legal requirements of bringing the children to Britain and finding homes and sponsors for them. This operation             was later known as the Czech Kindertransport (German for 'children's transport').

            His humanitarian accomplishments remained unknown and unnoticed by the world for nearly 50 years until 1988 when he               was invited to the BBC television programme That's Life!, where he was reunited with dozens of the children he had               helped come to Britain and was introduced to many of their children and grandchildren. The British press celebrated               him and dubbed him the <strong>"British Schindler"</strong>. In 2003, Winton was knighted by <em>Queen Elizabeth II</em> for "services to               humanity, in saving Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia".In 2014, he was awarded the highest honour             of the Czech Republic, the Order of the <strong>White Lion</strong> (1st class), by Czech President Miloš Zeman. Winton died in 2015,             aged 106.

            <em>Sir Nicholas George Winton</em>, born on May 19, 1909, became an unsung hero whose remarkable deeds saved the lives of hundreds during the tumultuous times of World War II. A British stockbroker by trade, Winton's journey into heroism began in 1938 when he visited Prague and witnessed the desperate situation of Jewish refugees escaping Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. Responding to the urgency of the moment, Winton orchestrated the Czech Kindertransport, a daring rescue mission that transported 669 children to safety in Britain. What distinguishes Winton's story is the modesty with which he carried out his life-saving efforts. For nearly 50 years, he kept his actions hidden, only coming to light in 1988. Knighted by <strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> in 2003, Sir Nicholas Winton's legacy epitomizes the profound impact of one individual's compassion and resilience in the face of adversity.
            His humanitarian accomplishments were not confined to the past, as Winton continued to advocate for justice and altruism throughout his life. Devoting his later years to various charitable endeavors, he inspired others to follow in his footsteps, leaving an indelible mark on the philanthropic landscape.  Winton's legacy serves as a timeless reminder that the ripple effects of compassion and selflessness extend far beyond the immediate circumstances, shaping a brighter future for generations to come...

          <em>Sir Nicholas Winton</em>, a British humanitarian, orchestrated the rescue of hundreds of children from the imminent threat of Nazi occupation in Czechoslovakia during the late 1930s. In 1938, while visiting Prague, he witnessed the desperate plight of Jewish refugees and decided to take action. Winton, with the help of other volunteers, compiled meticulous lists of at-risk children, detailing their backgrounds. Facing the challenges of fundraising and bureaucratic hurdles, he tirelessly secured financial support, exit permits, and entry visas. Collaborating with British families willing to host the children, he ensured the matching of each child with a suitable foster family. Winton organized trains to transport the children to safety in Britain. Remarkably, his modesty led him to keep these efforts hidden for nearly 50 years, only coming to light in 1988 when his wife discovered a scrapbook documenting the rescue mission. In recognition of his extraordinary humanitarianism, Winton was knighted by <strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> in 2003.
